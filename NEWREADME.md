# DevOps Internship Task 1 - CI/CD Pipeline

## 🔧 What I Did

- Created a sample Node.js app (index.js, package.json)
- Wrote a Dockerfile to containerize the app
- Set up GitHub Actions (main.yml) to build & push Docker image
- Used GitHub secrets for Docker login (DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD)
- Workflow successfully builds the image

## ⚠️ Push Error Note

Due to GitHub Actions runner network issue (server misbehaving), the Docker image *couldn't be pushed* automatically.

> ❗ But the pipeline, Dockerfile, and secrets are correctly configured ✅
